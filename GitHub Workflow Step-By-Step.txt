Just a quick step by step rundown of github merging workflow.

1. Make sure whenever you make changes, you are in your branch (or at least a branch other than main and development; you can make branches as copies of development branch as this should be the latest working version of the project with updated changes.)

2. Once you are done making changes, commit and push your changes on your branch.

3. Go to the branch tab, and at the bottom select "choose a branch to merge into (your branch)". Merge development into your branch.

4. Check to make sure your branch still works and nothing broke. Fix any errors.

5. Once you are sure everything is still working, swap branches back to development, select "choose a branch to merge into development" from the branch tab, and merge your branch into development. There should be no errors as everything should be working in yours before merging.
